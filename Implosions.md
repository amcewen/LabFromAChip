Theoretical Repertoire :book: :package:
---------------------------------------

![](images/boromir_meme_ready.jpg){width="400"}

In my research on kit culture, I try to build up a theoretical
repertoire for tuning into what might be going on across various forms
of biological knowledge production, then use this repertoire to make
kits, a kind of `critical-making`.

These kits then become handy "boundary objects", objects that people
from different disciplines or practices can use or understand, for
exploring further and more intimately, growing the repertoire, making
more kits with more people and so on. In my case they allow an artist
doing research, 'laypersons'(different 'publics') and
'specialists'(scientists and their students) understand each other.

But also and this is what I now understand as a big part of my artistic
practice and the practice of [Domestic
Science](https://domesticscience.org.uk/about.html), most commonly the
kits and activities I make and facilitate become objects to talk over
and around.

I build the repertoire by reading through making, making through reading
and talking.

-   Review a range of kit and kit like practices that condense into a
    [Library of
    kits](https://domesticscience.org.uk/criticalkits/Library.html), a
    kit literature.
-   Briefly review literatures of the history of the philosophy of
    science in response to practices and kits I make with people.
-   Review literatures in STS Method, structured by emerging kits.

With this repertoire and armed with my boundary negotiating kits:

-   Observe Craft practices in teaching microbiology undergraduates at
    the Division for Biomedical Life Science at Lancaster University
-   Observe me making kits with researchers and students
-   Making kits and facilitating activity based on them in makerspace
    DoESLiverpool and other sites in the worlds related to my art
    practice.

### Imaginaries

STS method includes the use of ethnographic or other styles of 'case
study'. This kit is one such emerging case. Ideas like socio technical
imaginaries are relevant when thinking about what is really going on in
powerful ideas like ***Lab on a chip***

*"Throughout the modern world, science and technology (S&T) are deeply
implicated in producing collective visions of good and attainable
futures. These "sociotechnical imaginaries" have proved particularly
useful for policymakers in late modern societies. Imagined futures help
justify new investments in S&T; in turn, advances in S&T reaffirm the
state's capacity to act as responsible stewards of the public good.
Sociotechnical imaginaries serve in this respect both as the ends of
policy and as instruments of legitimation.*

*...but other imaginaries are also often at play in the world, based on
different cultural understandings of the good life. Public hopes and
fears concerning S&T engage in unpredictable ways with forms of
imagination current in policy worlds. Publics also construct and act
upon their own imaginaries of those in power and hold policymakers
responsible in accordance with their tacit or explicit notions of
discovery, innovation, efficiency, progress, uncertainty, evidence,
argument, value, legitimation.*

*Another way to understand a concept is to see how it works alongside
others....imaginaries help explain why, out of the universe of
possibilities, some envisionings of scientific and social order tend to
win support over others---in other words, why some orderings are
co-produced at the expense of others.\"*

### The Lab-On-A-Chip Imaginary

Lab on a chip tech builds an interesting 'public imaginary', a narrative
for both layperson and specialist, as a form of biological or chemical
manufacturing akin to the so called silicon 'revolution'.

Like Integrated circuits they are very small environments for
manipulating and interpreting the behaviour of matter. Like their
silicon cousins they generate alot of hype, hope, fear, hard cash and
financialisation and hopefully something 'good'.

Unlike these circuits, lab-on-a-chips manipulate much bigger things than
electrons, big, scary molecules just as weird as any tiny quantum
packets, but so complicated it can make your head spin as fast as an
accountant at the Large Hadron Collider: big proteins like DNA,
bioassays and super collaborating symbiotic mega-communities which have
the added complication of not only ***being alive*** but containing mind
boggling histories encoded inside every part of them.

What **Lab on a chip** imaginaries are made?

-   Scalable distributable labs that work 'on their own'
-   Disrupting the field of bio and chemical manufacturing
-   Somehow it's intelligent, and automated
-   Labs can work 'anywhere'
-   Labs are small but powerful
-   Myths of new biological computers made by existing biological
    computers
-   These are like kits: they package up some bio processes and make
    them super mobile and easy
-   They are going to 'revolutionise' access to the industry, which you
    can see in the [Metafluidics](https://metafluidics.org/)\
-   Realise the genetics-to-order shop scenes of science fiction like
    Bladerunner etc.\
-   It has all the intersections of biology, engineering, well meaning
    utility and agency for frugal science in 'intractable' places

### Invisible Work

*"I took exception to a comment on maker education twitter a while back
that kits used in tech education workshops are a great idea because they
'save time' in workshops; this could not be further from the truth. That
well meaning comment unintentionally reveals what's missing in
understanding kits and by extension the whole maker meme and from there,
other creative practice that uses technology in social settings: The
care, thought, iterative failure, maintenance and communal resilience
required for their success."*

[My blog on Critical
Kits](http://cheapjack.github.io/2018/07/05/critical-kit-resilience)

This chimes with Susan Leigh Stars description of the invisible work
that goes on behind scientific facts and products

*"People may see a map of a genome or a syringe full of experimental
medication. These are just the end products, however, of a web of
relationships, what Lave and Wenger have called communities of practice.
Lave and Wenger make the strong claim that membership in these
communities constitutes learning and science (Adler and Obstfeld, in
press; Bowker and Star, 1999: Chapter 10; Lave and Wenger, 1991;
Obstfeld, 2005). These relationships are usually invisible to readers of
science and technology (Star and Strauss, 1999; Suchman, 1987)."*

(Bryant, Anthony. Charmaz, Kathy ed. (2011) *The SAGE handbook of
grounded theory* Los Angeles: Sage

*"Scientific journals are full of articles that delete the development,
setting, communication practices, and 'grunt work' involved in doing
science."*

(Ibid.)

#### Configuration

***Configuration*** takes these imaginaries further and feel
particularly relevant to the 'invisible work' and 'talking' that are
bound up in science, technology and kit making

*"drawing our analytic attention to the ways in which technologies
materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the
significance of technical artefacts."*

*\"\"Configuration, I have suggested here, is part of a toolkit for
thinking about constitutive and generative, reiterative and
(potentially) transformative material-semiotic conjoining. In the case
of technology, configuration orients us to the entanglement of
imaginaries and artefacts that comprise technological projects.*

*While normative methods are designed to define and police boundaries,
configuration as a method assemblage aims to articulate method in a way
that opens received and/or congealed relations to being re-enacted
differently (see Law, 2004: 84).\"*

Inspiring Interventions

[Mikroskopisk PacMan](https://youtu.be/GvZm9EXqrdU) Erik Andrew
Johannessen's high end microfluidics game is worth looking at for a
playful exploration. Check out the [full video
here](https://www.youtube.com/TVxNvWCTbYo) and read the [Vice
article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7zba/pac-man-inspires-norwegian-researchers-to-better-study-microorganisms)
if you like that kind of thing. Back in the 1960s when the military
funded the shrinking of transistors nobody thought they'd use it for fun
with ghosts, stories and pictures of cats, just bombs and tracking
communists, but just look at the weird cultures that turned into! I
wonder where microfluidics will take us? Should we be even doing this?
What knowledge and 'goods' does it make?

Helen Pritchard's [Critters on a
chip](http://www.helenpritchard.info/artworks-projects/critter-compiler-prototype-2016)
suggests we might get organisms in microfluidic environments writing
code and literature.
