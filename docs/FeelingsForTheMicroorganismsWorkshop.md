Lab-from-a-chip is a kit for collaborating with microscopic model organisms - freshwater algae - inspired by the practices of microbiology, maker culture and Science and Technology studies, part of artist Ross Dalziel's PhD research - a form of art-science - at the [Division for BioMedical Life Sciences at Lancaster University (BLS)](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/biomedical-and-life-sciences/) and makerspace [DoESLiverpool](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/biomedical-and-life-sciences).

With collaborators at [Domestic Science](https://domesticscience.org.uk/) our workshop uses safe simple accessible micro moulding techniques to interact with the microscopic material surfaces of our everyday modern world - the surfaces of a microchip, an old vinyl record, the texture of a phone case - with living photosynthetic algae.  

We use a standard Foldscope kit fresh from engineer Manu Prakash's [Foldscope Shop](https://www.foldscope.com/) with extra materials to help people explore the world of DIY microfluidics.

## Feeling For the Microorganims

We are inspired by Evelyn Fox Keller's fascinating biography of geneticist Barbara McClintock, *A Feeling For The Organism* and the intimate care for living things - human and non-human - required of all workers in the life sciences. This workshop aims to explore and reflect on the value of everyday biomedical research and practice - a 21st century domestic science that considers everyone's labour - particularly in biomedicine, health and wellbeing - and aims to reconnect to our passions to look after organisms other than ourselves. 


## Features

 * Play with silicon chips and the surfaces of the technoscientific materials we use everyday.  
 * Pay with stretchy see-through hands on food safe silicon polymers!
 * Model Organisms, Biology's non-human collaborators!
 * [Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek) style DIY orgigami Microscopes by [Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com/)
 * *Euglena gracilis* algae, critters that move like animals but eat like plants
 * Making microscopic moulds from everyday technology and capturing images with smartphones, computers and the naked eye


## Background

<img alt="Workshop at Liverpool John Moores University with Dr Rod Dillon, 2019" src="images/workshopmontage.jpg" width="400">

This is part of Artist Ross Dalziel's art-science PhD embedded in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University and makerspace [DoESLiverpool](https://doesliverpool.com), exploring critical making in kit cultures, *Critical Kits*. We're interested in what happens when you take a system from science and engineering, what Science and Technology Studies (STS) calls 'technoscience' and try to make it something that can be done outside of the "secluded research" (Callon et al.Â 2009. *Acting in an uncertain world : an essay on technical democracy* USA: MIT Press) of the science lab; how you could use this to reflect on healthy relationships, care and maintenance of the world .
