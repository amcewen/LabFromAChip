## Getting started

Your kit should include [this inventory](#inventory) You should have had time to play with your foldscope and get used to capturing images on your phone. Here's a fast and dirty assembly if you're in a rush to get going. Practice capturing images before you make your first moulds though!

We've included a random pre-prepared slide donated from a microscope enthusiast from the Wirral in Merseyside.

### Quick Foldscope Assembly üî¨

We are going to do a quick build of a
[Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com/) Prakesh Labs ingenious bit of
microengineering for frugal science.

1.  Open up your foldscope kit and open the instructions. We are going
    to just build the lens stage and focus ramp, a minimal build to look
    at some algae and make moulds and connect to our phone cameras.
    Steps 1 - 6, and step 10. of the **ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS**
    1.  Insert coupler into Lens stage
    2.  Insert another coupler into the reverse of the stage
    3.  Fold and lock the bottom flap
    4.  Insert lens into the Lens stage.
    5.  Fold the Focus ramp
    6.  Insert ramp into stage
    7.  Fold the bottom of the Lens stage.


### Slide prep üêõ 

<img src="bookletimages/13.png" height="200">

Inject equal amounts (0.5ml) of silicon from syringe A and fixer from syringe B into the 'floor' your mini petri dish (it's the smaller diameter part)

<img src="bookletimages/14.png" height="200">
<img src="bookletimages/15.png" height="200">

Mix well and add lid

<img src="bookletimages/16.png" height="200">

Carefully spin with your DIY paperfuge! 

<img src="bookletimages/17.png" height="200">

Another tricky bit! Use the micro disposable pipette to inject a drop of algae suspenstion into the side of the impressed silicon. Capilliary action should pull the liquid into the tiny impressions of the chip surface markings or the vinyl channels

Insert your prepared slide here (be careful slotting it in not to push your coverslip away)


That's it! You're ready! Now setup your phone with the Foldscope and see if our algal friends have found their way into the microfluidic channels. We've found that the vinyl record is the most rewarding, as you really get to see our *Euglena gracilis* moving along the grooves and you could try imagine how slow the music might sound like at their speed. With your phone setup you could try shining the LED included and see how they respond.

These organisms are mixotrophic in that they 'eat' proteins and plant matter but also photosynthesise, so like plants 'make' food from sunlight. They are like plants but also behave like animals.

Have a think what other ordinary stuff we have in our homes and workplaces that might have tiny spaces the size of record grooves or silicon chip logos? What about textiles? The surface of your phone or pair of running shoes/trainers/sneakers? An old pair of headphones? The surface of some wood or steel? Once you put yourself in the Algae's position the human engineered world becomes like a whole world.

### Connect to phone. ü§≥ üì∑

Refer to **Phone View** in **VIEWING** section overleaf.

1.  Take the round white double sided peel off sticker and stick it
    carefully over your phone camera lens, make sure you dont get the
    glue on the lens. It comes off with water if you do üòÄ

2.  Remove the white cover. Now theres a sticky side facing up.

3.  Take the other coupler and place it silver side down over the lens.
    Keep the lens central to the couplers hole.

If you setup near a window or open laptop this serves as a good overall light source but experiment with the included LED & battery, known in Maker circles as an LED throwie

#### LED throwie

<img src="images/19.png" height="200">

We've included an LED and battery which you can use for extra lighting with the help of your tape. You can also use them as an [LED Throwie](https://makezine.com/projects/led-throwies/) for guerilla LED graffitti on the macroscale.

*Euglena gracilis* are popular in the [field of Biotic games]() Use your LED to see if you can make the algae move in the direction you wantto see if you can make the algae move in the direction you want. If you look carefully you'll see their tiny red spot which is sensitive to light, they'll make their way toward the light as for them (like us) it's a source of food and energy

### Inventory 

<img src="bookletimages/1.png" height="200">

Prepared & labelled syringes filled with PDMS (A) & hardener (B). PDMS is a non-volatile silicon and safe to handle, but not ingest. We advise taking care to wash your hands thoroughly after use and store them in the already open plastic sleeves. Unmixed they store for up to a year. Be careful not to cross contaminate the A & B components or they will harden in storage. 

<img src="bookletimages/6.png" height="200">


555 Timer chip. Common chip in maker projects. See https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/WearableTechBadgeWorkshop/blob/master/555Tutorials.md for what you can make with timers. 

<img src="bookletimages/2.png" height="200">

Micro-petri-dish with lid. Mix PDMS together and make impressions with chip surfaces. You could use anything you think might make tiny  impressions in the surface of your PDMS mould. 

<img src="bookletimages/7.png" height="200">


1.5ml Eppendorf with safe-lid containing an algae suspension of Euglena gracilis. You can see Euglena [in action here](https://youtu.be/ghMFiTQJU-M)  

<img src="bookletimages/VinylFragment.png" height="200">

Vinyl fragment. Some of you may not remember, but at the dawn of pop culture and capitalism music was distributed widely on vinyl discs as micrometre scale grooves that could be amplified and played back

<img src="bookletimages/8.png" height="200">

1.3ml Disposable micro pipette

<img src="bookletimages/9.png" height="200">

Blank glass Microscope slide with cover slips for your own PDMS mould. Take care with the glass cover slips

<img src="bookletimages/11.png" height="200">


Plastic tweezers for removing your set PDMS impressions

<img src="bookletimages/12.png" height="200">


Standard Foldscope classroom kit, instructions, sticker set, lens cleaning q-tip, lighting stage and lens/phone assembly


<img src="bookletletimages/10.png" alt="Picture of prepared slide" height="200">

Pre-prepared PDMS with coverslip slide made from old vinyl record. This is to help you get started but you can make your own by 'painting' mixed PDMS onto your own records or other surfaces

**NOTE** This is only in later complete kits

<img src="bookletimages/VinylFragment.png" height="200">

Vinyl record Fragment. Some of you may not have a record collection and listen on big data infrastuctures like Spotify or YouTube or maybe if you care about artists getting paid, Bandcamp. You can't really get impressions from these sources although if you could access their server racks in the correct data centre you could find a hard drive that likely has some micro-engineered structures but you'd get in trouble!

<img src="images/18.jpg" height="200">

LED & Battery. For lighting up your *Euglena gracilis* Watch 'em go!

<img src="images/tape.jpg" alt="Picture of micro sellotape" height="200">

Easy tear sellotape for fixing your slide to the 'scope and securing your petri dish when using the paperfuge.
